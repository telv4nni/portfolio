Here's a repository with portfolio of my works. Most of them where created for CS50 course and are partially done by myself. 

Please especially take a look into /integrals as it is my most complex project yet and done by myself from top to the bottom. 
You may also want to have a look into /fiftyville to see my queries profficiency. /finance is worth mentioning as it is web based app with login system and uses databases. 
/aidegrees and /aitictactoe are my attempts to learn new programming skills on ongoing CS50 AI course.

Thanks,
Hubert
