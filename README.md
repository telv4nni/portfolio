Here's a repository with portfolio of my works. There are a lot of python applications and SQL queries to prove my skills as data analyst.

Please especially take a look into /Integrals Calculator as it is my most complex project yet and done by myself from top to the bottom. It calculates integrals with visual GUI written in Python. 

There is my case study made in /PowerBI to showcase another necessary set of skills for data analysis.

You may want to look into /SQL too. You will find there SQL queries that showcase my skills with data manipulation. They are part of https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/ and will get updated in the future. Each file represents one week.

Most of my works are part of CS50 and are done by myself.
You may also want to have a look into CS50/fiftyville to see my SQL queries profficiency. CS50/finance is worth mentioning as it is web based app with login system and uses databases. 
CS50/aidegrees and CS50/aitictactoe are my attempts to learn new programming skills on ongoing CS50 AI course.

Thanks,
Hubert
