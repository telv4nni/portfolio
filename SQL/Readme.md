Hi there,

Here you'll find my SQL queries that show my profficiency in data manipulation. All of these queries are part of case studies from https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/.
Inside .txt files you'll find links to dibbles with SQL database schemas that are necessary in order to run queries and questions followed by queries to get the answers.

All files are named in convention 'sql#.txt' where # is the week of the SQL challange. 

Thanks, 
Hubert
