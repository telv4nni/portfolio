Hi there,

This is my Data Analysis case study in PowerBI. The purpose is to learn something new and showcase my familiarity with PowerBI environment. I had not only made visualizations but needed to do a lot of data transformation for this one.

Data Source: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artermiloff/steam-games-dataset

I am using public data from Kaggle Datasets Library, for this analysis I decided to use 'games_march2025_cleaned.csv' to skip data cleaning and do only data checks.
Data is very recent as last entries are from May 2025. Data is consistent in all entries and ready to work with. It wasn't as comprehensive as I would like to, I couldn't answer all of my questions. 
It is reliable source because data is gathered using Steam API and Steam Spy.

Questions I asked myself:
1. How looks genre distribution and what is most popular genre?
2. Is there any trending genre on the course of the years?
3. Which genres are best scored by users?
4. How does game distribution look when it comes to paid vs free games?
5. Which genres does favor free games the most?
6. What's the average and median price for the games?
7. Does a game genre have impact on a price?
8. Do release year affect the price of the game?
9. Do release month affect the price?
10. How are prices changing across the years? Not enough data
11. What are the most popular games? All-time and recent.
12. Is there any correlation between price/score/release date/peak players? Couldn't find any
13. What are the top developers?
14. Which are the most supported languages?
15. How much of the market supports polish language and is there a change across years?

I hope you had fun exploring some of my visualizations.

Thanks,
Hubert
