        <h2>Warsaw</h2>
        <div>
        I was born and lived my whole life in Warsaw. It is capital city of Poland with almost 2 millions inhabitants. It's largest city in Poland and placed directly in center of it. I like to call it New York of Poland because of it's large quantity of skyscrapers. I really love it, it's pretty during the night and very lively. Below you can find most iconic places there in slides:

                  <h5>Pałac Kultury i Nauki</h5>
                  <p>This building is named Pałac Kultury i Nauki which translates roughly into Mansion of Culture and Science. It's most iconic building and sign of Warsaw. It was built by Soviets in 1952 in style of art deco. Right now it's used as central cultural place of Warsaw and seat of administration.</p>

                  <h5>Zamek Królewski</h5>
                  <p>This is Royal Castle of Warsaw. It was built in XIII century and was many times expanded since this time. It was fully destroyed during II World War and rebuilt after that. Same fate happened to many building in the old town in which it's located. In fact Warsaw was destroyed in 80% after the war and there are no original structures here :(</p>

                  <p>Warsaw National Stadium was finished in 2012. It is biggest and most well equiped stadium in Poland. We do love football here and we are really on our toes when watching EURO championships. There are many concerts held there as it can accomodate more than 70 000 people.</p>

Warsaw is the greenest of the large cities in Poland and there are many more places for recreation. This one is most iconic of them. Used to be hunting ground for royalty.</p>
