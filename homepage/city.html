It was built by Soviets in 1952 in style of art deco. Right now it's used as central cultural place of Warsaw and seat of administration."></td>

            title="This is Royal Castle of Warsaw. It was built in XIII century and was many times expanded since this time. It was fully destroyed during II World War and rebuilt after that. Same fate happened to many building in the old town in which it's located. In fact Warsaw was destroyed in 80% after the war and there are no original structures here :("></td>
