Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: That 100 simulations was actually faster than 10.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I think 10000 is enough because the results are similiar between runs and run time is still much less than 1 second.
